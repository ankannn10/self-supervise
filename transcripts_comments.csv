Let us Listen to the Voice of God Through the Holy Souls in Purgatory by Sensus Fidelium.,"allegations that the Serbian government is very - - closely linked to organized crime groups, including Belivuk‚Äôs group. I visited my Serbian colleague, Stevan Dojƒçinoviƒá, in Belgrade. He is probably the most renowned investigative journalist in all of Serbia - - known for his investigations into Serbian politicians and organized crime. This is what he told me when I asked him about Belivuk. To understand what Stevan's talking about, we need to take a little step - - back to 2017, three years before ‚ÄúThe Slaughterhouse‚Äù murders. So police got Belivuk‚Äôs phone, and made a report on the WhatsApp messages they found inside. This report was actually first published by the magazine NIN. I also want to make clear that this report on Belivuk‚Äôs WhatsApp messages - - was never supposed to fall into the hands of journalists. But there's another incident with this police officer - - that is even more fascinating. It's actually a secret recording of him - - when he‚Äôs holding a meeting with Belivuk‚Äôs men. A source contacted Stevan and handed over - - an audio recording of this meeting. I want to go now, lastly, back to the messages - - between the gendarme and Belivuk. It wasn't just one rogue police official. It goes much deeper. So here, the gendarme writes to Belivuk: The gendarme mentions a woman named Dijana. He is referring to Dijana Hrkaloviƒá as confirmed by the secret police report. So Dijana, the second most powerful police official in Serbia - - failed to hand over the very WhatsApp messages that implicated herself with Belivuk. So is all of this the biggest scandal in Serbia? No. Dijana was only charged with abuse of office, and she's already out of prison. Nothing happened to the gendarme. He is still on the police force as far as we know. The only ones in jail"
¬†@outlawedTV88¬† and that is why over 50 000 people leave Serbia every year,"is his story. Veljko Belivuk, who we‚Äôll just call Belivuk, is the leader of a Serbian group called the Principi. In the region, criminal groups get very complicated. So for the purposes of this story, you just need to remember two of them: The Kavaƒç clan. And the ≈†kaljari clan. And they are at war with each other. Now Belivuk‚Äôs group, which roughly translates into ‚ÄúThe Principled‚Äù, is allied with the Kavaƒç. His clan is mostly - - street level muscle and enforcers made up of football hooligans - - supporting Serbia's Partizan football team. When I say football hooligans, you might not take it too seriously. But in the Balkans - - it‚Äôs very serious business, with a lot of history and nationalism. And the stadium - - has always been a firm recruiting ground for organized crime groups. So Belivuk‚Äôs group is at war. The two groups are assassinated each other with car bombs, snipers, you name it. They are killing and being killed. But these sorts of murders left bodies. So Belivuk‚Äôs group developed a motto: ‚Äúno body, no crime.‚Äù And a unique place to realize it for their enemies. They called it ‚ÄúThe Slaughterhouse.‚Äù Our understanding of what happened - - is from the testimony of three crew members turned witnesses, the indictment, and the Sky messages exchanged as the crew went about planning these murders. At the same time, it's very important for me to say that the trial is ongoing. No one has been convicted, and the accused deny the charges. This was the first victim of the slaughterhouse - - for which we have ample photographic and Sky evidence. He was actually Belivuk‚Äôs friend and a member of the group. But Belivuk got the idea that he was a traitor. Belivuk had a clear message‚Ä¶ From the day of the murder, we have CCTV stills"

Now Belivuk‚Äôs group, which roughly translates into ‚ÄúThe Principled‚Äù, is allied with the Kavaƒç. His clan is mostly - - street level muscle and enforcers made up of football hooligans - - supporting Serbia's Partizan football team. When I say football hooligans, you might not take it too seriously. But in the Balkans - - it‚Äôs very serious business, with a lot of history and nationalism. And the stadium - - has always been a firm recruiting ground for organized crime groups. So Belivuk‚Äôs group is at war. The two groups are assassinated each other with car bombs, snipers, you name it. They are killing and being killed. But these sorts of murders left bodies. So Belivuk‚Äôs group developed a motto: ‚Äúno body, no crime.‚Äù And a unique place to realize it for their enemies. They called it ‚ÄúThe Slaughterhouse.‚Äù Our understanding of what happened - - is from the testimony of three crew members turned witnesses, the indictment, and the Sky messages exchanged as the crew went about planning these murders. At the same time, it's very important for me to say that the trial is ongoing. No one has been convicted, and the accused deny the charges. This was the first victim of the slaughterhouse - - for which we have ample photographic and Sky evidence. He was actually Belivuk‚Äôs friend and a member of the group. But Belivuk got the idea that he was a traitor. Belivuk had a clear message‚Ä¶ From the day of the murder, we have CCTV stills"
Mexico in Europe huh,"this story is because these supposedly - - uncrackable, highly encrypted phones were, in fact, cracked. And here's how it happened. Most people are familiar with mobile apps like Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal. These are the most popular services that offer encryption. They're all thought to be secure to some extent, meaning authorities are not known to be able to break the encryption - - and read the messages. But this group was using modified phones and software - - made by a company in Canada called Sky Global. They were advertised as some form of ultimate security. In addition to strong encryption, they had features like self-destructing messages - - and the ability to wipe the phone remotely. Now in 2019, European authorities started a cross-border investigation - - because they suspected that - - these phones were being almost exclusively used by criminals. The authorities discovered the backup servers were in France. And in 2020, a specialized encryption unit is able - - to crack the group messages feature of these Sky phones. So now authorities are able to secretly read over 2 million messages. And this is about the same time - - that the gruesome murders in the Serbian home start taking place. We can deduce that European authorities - - decrypted these extremely gruesome photos, grew extremely concerned, and decided to share these photos with Serbian authorities. And once Serbian authorities get this information, they're able - - to determine that one of the suspects is actually quite famous. His name is Veljko Belivuk. And this is his story.

But in 2021, when police searched it - - they found a secret door in the garage leading to a hidden room. And in this room, they found an industrial meat grinder. But this meat grinder wasn't used for animals. It was used by a criminal group to grind up human beings. They tortured their victims, often decapitated them, extracted the organs, cut them into small pieces, and then put the flesh through the grinder. They bagged the remains, and carried them to the nearby Danube river, where they dumped them in the water. How do we know this?

"I am a Serbian. 
First, I want to thank you for the video. I also want to highlight some things. The Serbian reporter speaks the truth, but it still can sound blurry to those who are not familiar with our ways of life. 

The reason why Belivuk's group was arrested was because the government wanted to avoid an international scandal. They knew about the crimes. Yet, it was quite possible they did not know the details. We are quite rebellious people, and we need a certain level of freedom and going rogue (unsupervised). So, when government officials influence/direct criminal groups, they do so for certain purposes. But never forget, those groups do not exist for those purposes. They see themselves in a different light, with their mission, their code of honour, and their goals and tactics. So, they get government's officials goals done, but also operate on their own. Also, the officials themselves, even those from the same party, are highly decentralized and self-motivated. Serbian ""power scene"" is a very complex web of blood (family relations), ideals (nationalism, etc), money, and foreign influences. And you never really know who is who.","is his story.

Mexico in the middle of Europe.,"It looks like a simple house in a rural suburb outside of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. Nothing looks out of order, from the outside. But in 2021, when police searched it - - they found a secret door in the garage leading to a hidden room. And in this room, they found an industrial meat grinder. But this meat grinder wasn't used for animals. It was used by a criminal group to grind up human beings. They tortured their victims, often decapitated them, extracted the organs, cut them into small pieces, and then put the flesh through the grinder. They bagged the remains, and carried them to the nearby Danube river, where they dumped them in the water. How do we know this? Because the criminal group took pictures of the process, and then they sent these pictures to their friends to brag. And sometimes they also sent the pictures to their enemies to taunt and warn them. They documented this process - - all on highly specialized, encrypted phones that they thought were secure. They never thought the phones‚Äô encryption could be cracked, but it was. And no one thought this whole brutal mess would connect - - to Serbian law enforcement and officials. But again, it did.

They tortured their victims, often decapitated them, extracted the organs, cut them into small pieces, and then put the flesh through the grinder. They bagged the remains, and carried them to the nearby Danube river, where they dumped them in the water. How do we know this? Because the criminal group took pictures of the process, and then they sent these pictures to their friends to brag. And sometimes they also sent the pictures to their enemies to taunt and warn them. They documented this process - - all on highly specialized, encrypted phones that they thought were secure. They never thought the phones‚Äô encryption could be cracked, but it was. And no one thought this whole brutal mess would connect - - to Serbian law enforcement and officials. But again, it did.

"""The Chilling Story of Serbia's Human Slaughterhouse"" likely refers to the atrocities committed during the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, particularly during the Bosnian War. These events are often depicted in various documentaries, articles, and books that detail the horrific acts of ethnic cleansing and war crimes that took place in the region, including the use of makeshift slaughterhouses for the bodies of victims.

The reasons behind such brutal actions are complex and often rooted in deep-seated ethnic tensions, nationalism, and political motivations. Leaders may exploit these tensions to gain power or control over territories. The actions taken during the conflict were fueled by a mix of historical grievances, identity politics, and the breakdown of social order.

The use of the term ""human slaughterhouse"" evokes the dehumanization of victims and the extreme violence that characterized some of the wartime practices. These events are reminders of the potential for human rights violations during conflict and the importance of remembering history to prevent such atrocities from happening again.","is his story.

They were arrested few days later and put on trial for all the killigs.

"I am a Serbian. 
First, I want to thank you for the video. I also want to highlight some things. The Serbian reporter speaks the truth, but it still can sound blurry to those who are not familiar with our ways of life. 

The reason why Belivuk's group was arrested was because the government wanted to avoid an international scandal. They knew about the crimes. Yet, it was quite possible they did not know the details. We are quite rebellious people, and we need a certain level of freedom and going rogue (unsupervised). So, when government officials influence/direct criminal groups, they do so for certain purposes. But never forget, those groups do not exist for those purposes. They see themselves in a different light, with their mission, their code of honour, and their goals and tactics. So, they get government's officials goals done, but also operate on their own. Also, the officials themselves, even those from the same party, are highly decentralized and self-motivated. Serbian ""power scene"" is a very complex web of blood (family relations), ideals (nationalism, etc), money, and foreign influences. And you never really know who is who.","is his story.

Mexico in the middle of Europe.,"It looks like a simple house in a rural suburb outside of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. Nothing looks out of order, from the outside. But in 2021, when police searched it - - they found a secret door in the garage leading to a hidden room. And in this room, they found an industrial meat grinder. But this meat grinder wasn't used for animals. It was used by a criminal group to grind up human beings. They tortured their victims, often decapitated them, extracted the organs, cut them into small pieces, and then put the flesh through the grinder. They bagged the remains, and carried them to the nearby Danube river, where they dumped them in the water. How do we know this? Because the criminal group took pictures of the process, and then they sent these pictures to their friends to brag. And sometimes they also sent the pictures to their enemies to taunt and warn them. They documented this process - - all on highly specialized, encrypted phones that they thought were secure. They never thought the phones‚Äô encryption could be cracked, but it was. And no one thought this whole brutal mess would connect - - to Serbian law enforcement and officials. But again, it did. I‚Äôm Matt Sarnecki, a journalist and filmmaker at the - - Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. I'm going to walk you through this whole bizarre story and introduce you - - to the journalist who connected this group's rise - to top Serbian officials. The only reason I can tell you this story is because these supposedly - - uncrackable, highly encrypted phones were, in fact, cracked. And here's how it happened.

Veljko Belivuk, who we‚Äôll just call Belivuk, is the leader of a Serbian group called the Principi. In the region, criminal groups get very complicated.

"Thank you to all you brave, honest journalists. Heros of our world.","allegations that the Serbian government is very - - closely linked to organized crime groups, including Belivuk‚Äôs group. I visited my Serbian colleague, Stevan Dojƒçinoviƒá, in Belgrade. He is probably the most renowned investigative journalist in all of Serbia - - known for his investigations into Serbian politicians and organized crime. This is what he told me when I asked him about Belivuk. To understand what Stevan's talking about, we need to take a little step - - back to 2017, three years before ‚ÄúThe Slaughterhouse‚Äù murders. So police got Belivuk‚Äôs phone, and made a report on the WhatsApp messages they found inside. This report was actually first published by the magazine NIN. I also want to make clear that this report on Belivuk‚Äôs WhatsApp messages - - was never supposed to fall into the hands of journalists. But there's another incident with this police officer - - that is even more fascinating. It's actually a secret recording of him - - when he‚Äôs holding a meeting with Belivuk‚Äôs men. A source contacted Stevan and handed over - - an audio recording of this meeting. I want to go now, lastly, back to the messages - - between the gendarme and Belivuk. It wasn't just one rogue police official. It goes much deeper. So here, the gendarme writes to Belivuk: The gendarme mentions a woman named Dijana. He is referring to Dijana Hrkaloviƒá as confirmed by the secret police report. So Dijana, the second most powerful police official in Serbia - - failed to hand over the very WhatsApp messages that implicated herself with Belivuk. So is all of this the biggest scandal in Serbia? No. Dijana was only charged with abuse of office, and she's already out of prison. Nothing happened to the gendarme. He is still on the police force as far as we know. The only ones in jail"

"You know all, mememeee","It looks like a simple house in a rural suburb outside of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. Nothing looks out of order, from the outside. But in 2021, when police searched it - - they found a secret door in the garage leading to a hidden room. And in this room, they found an industrial meat grinder. But this meat grinder wasn't used for animals. It was used by a criminal group to grind up human beings. They tortured their victims, often decapitated them, extracted the organs, cut them into small pieces, and then put the flesh through the grinder. They bagged the remains, and carried them to the nearby Danube river, where they dumped them in the water. How do we know this? Because the criminal group took pictures of the process, and then they sent these pictures to their friends to brag. And sometimes they also sent the pictures to their enemies to taunt and warn them. They documented this process - - all on highly specialized, encrypted phones that they thought were secure. They never thought the phones‚Äô encryption could be cracked, but it was. And no one thought this whole brutal mess would connect - - to Serbian law enforcement and officials. But again, it did.

"""The Chilling Story of Serbia's Human Slaughterhouse"" likely refers to the atrocities committed during the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, particularly during the Bosnian War. These events are often depicted in various documentaries, articles, and books that detail the horrific acts of ethnic cleansing and war crimes that took place in the region, including the use of makeshift slaughterhouses for the bodies of victims.

The reasons behind such brutal actions are complex and often rooted in deep-seated ethnic tensions, nationalism, and political motivations. Leaders may exploit these tensions to gain power or control over territories. The actions taken during the conflict were fueled by a mix of historical grievances, identity politics, and the breakdown of social order.

The use of the term ""human slaughterhouse"" evokes the dehumanization of victims and the extreme violence that characterized some of the wartime practices. These events are reminders of the potential for human rights violations during conflict and the importance of remembering history to prevent such atrocities from happening again.","is his story.

They cut off the victim's head with an ax. They wrote ‚ÄúKoraƒã Pussy‚Äù on his back in his own blood. Koraƒã was the name of the rival gang‚Äôs boss.

They brought him to the home above the slaughterhouse. They played with him. Made fun of his mask as they took pictures. But at the same time they were sending these pictures to their friends. They made him think he was there still to buy a gun, knowing full well that the whole thing was a ruse. Then they took him downstairs to the slaughterhouse. They joked... Then Belivuk took an ax and chopped off his head. And his friend got to work... Later they described the victim... And then - - Serbian police arrested of the gang. So that's it?

The idiots voting out the people actually making valid points is so irritating omgggg,black Americans able to serve in office in the early 1900s they were able to vote throughout the 1900s but yes there were pole taxes there was Jim Crow laws there was was segregation of course there was and we have to be yeah delal not to acknowledge those things okay so we can acknowledge all of those things can we also acknowledge due to the laws under Jim Crow that black people were significantly hindered from economic advancement this is a really important question the data shows not really it was evil it was terrible but black Americans are poor today in 2024 than they were in the 1950s yes why do you think that is good question so we have the Civil Rights Act we have more benefits more government programs something changed between the 1950s and 2024 so there's two answers to this question either America got more racist since 1950s 2024 so like that 70-year period because blacks America black Americans are worse off today per capita they you agree with that okay good yeah than in the 1950s or there's another explanation and I think the truth is somewhere in the middle which is I think you would acknowledge that the The Disappearance of the black father has been the number one driver of black poverty in this country now there are reasons for that yeah what do you think the reasons for that are well culture is one would you agree so actually let's go back to the foundation prison pipeline all that stuff but do at least can we at least agree that black dad's not being around is a bad thing anyone's father not being around is a bad thing of course but 75% of black youth are not raised with a father in the home it's the highest of any group in the
Nah,do you pay to go to church uh no I don't some people forced to pay based upon their particular denomination in today do you pay to go to church depending on the church no no you don't do you have to go to debt and to go to church uh in some circumstances people do because they have to give up 10% of their income to be able to do that which people can't circumstance well they're LDS you understand that a lot of LDS Churches specifically require 10% they don't require it and you're talk do in plenty of places well you're asking Mainline Christian isn't their stigmatization if you don't do that okay you're good at interrupting not good at answering well you haven't answered any of my questions yet I did say no church is not a scam church is the bride of Christ college is a scam and college is people are going into debt they're paying a lot of money but I want to ask you a question you said it's a scam for some people who is it a scam for yeah for people who specifically aren't ever going to use it never use any of the knowledge that they from it well you say 52% I don't think you can grant qualify 52% of people don't do that for example for example my job that's not going to be recommended like as like an economics degree and most economics Majors AR going to go into Tik Tok debating online but I use the information that I learned in college in like on in my job on a daily basis so I still qualities that are then used in my job later on what percentage of kids that go to college are being scammed can you I don't think I don't think anyone knows that
why not put this one and the liberal one agaist each other since they're the only ones capable of debating are are the only ones with research?,first of all if you count the abortion pill you're right but that's a separate thing than a chemic chemical abortion and surgical abortion different things and I'm not debating I'm not I'm not debating you I'm debating her so if you want to do the flags and come back in try and be faster next time so let me ask you this so the question is we should try to limit unjust suffering of human beings right sure okay that's my position is that there's unjust suffering of anywhere between 1.4 to 1.6 million abortions a year of human beings that are being massacred in the womb and so that's not a woman's rights issue that's not a men's rights issue that's just a human rights issue okay the best way to decrease abortions happening is proper sex education limiting abortion and making abortion illegal does not actually decrease the amount of abortions that happen so what is your evidence of that what is my evidence of that because we have increased sex education last 30 years we've had no our sex education is so bad in America well by bad what do you mean by that we have we have more access to birth control for young kids we have more kids that are learning you birth control at a younger age we have more of that in our public school system and we've seen all the trends actually go in a negative Direction so in fact we see that the more sex exucation there is the the more disturbing those Trends are so you say that let me ask just one more thing you say that if we make abortion illegal people will still do it should we then just make gang violence legal because no I'm saying if you actually wanted to decrease the amount of abortions that
Today I learned that debates are 85% asking questions back and forth and only 15% answering each other's questions,these types of areas but I think it's best that people get involved in debate and entertainment as it helps people grow and critically think in our society I thought it was very valuable I hope people learned something um I think the students were able to refine their arguments and hopefully this gets seen by millions of people where they're able to see what side they land on uh but yeah it's not easy just to stand there be 20 on one but uh only at Jubilee media
Do more of these,those Trends are so you say that let me ask just one more thing you say that if we make abortion illegal people will still do it should we then just make gang violence legal because no I'm saying if you actually wanted to decrease the amount of abortions that happen you wouldn't be advocating for a like to make abortion illegal you'd be advocating for Alles that logic apply to stealing looting kidnapping ARS sin and murder well actually it does because those are results of different societal issues that you should be educating yourself on rather than making ital front can we should we make kidnapping arson burgly murder legal because they're symptoms of something else we should be helping Society heal from those things got answer the question we want less of those things so we just make them legal will get less looting you know actually I'm going to let someone else thank you very much [Music] hi Parker nice to meet you yes nice to meet you Charlie big Tick Tock guy here so like uh pedophiles people who were married to children in the past and normalized in that Society should they go to prison should pedophiles like if you could go back in time would you put those pedophiles in prison that was that married those children because it was normalized they were deceived into thinking it's okay would you put them in prison you had to slow down file should get the death penalty no so you'd go back in the past you give them the death penalty even though they were deceived into thinking it was okay but you said people who get abortions who are women shouldn't go to pris but it's not currently illegal okay regardless at that time at that time it wasn't no I would not go back and
do a part two with different liberals this was entertaining asf,kind of filibustering to get people to not be able to make the points that they want to make and I definitely feel like he did that to me look Charlie's a talented guy there's a reason why he spoke at the RNC he's media trained he's had conversations like this before and he's built a career on dunking on college students but for a bunch of liberal students who don't have that same type of media training and who aren't as prepared to be in confrontational formats like this I thought they did a really good job of our articulating their views yeah Mason was the smartest kid for sure uh Parker needs to calm down very smart but kept on changing the topic uh but he's got talent very annoying though smart but Annoying Parker definitely gave Charlie a run for his money yeah Parker ate Parker ate that down one girl was very nasty she was a very nasty person she overly personalized it I honestly don't regret any of the things I said the only thing I would have taken back is I said at the end I as I walked away I said I hope your daughter can get away from you that one was a dig and that was my bad but honestly in the case of her being a 10-year-old pregnant and he won't let her get medical help that's just wild to me I can't believe that I think the group did very great it's a very hard environment for people to learn in these types of areas but I think it's best that people get involved in debate and entertainment as it helps people grow and critically think in our society I thought it was very valuable I hope people learned something um I think the students were able to refine their arguments
please do college students vs 1 liberal,how many I hope your daughter lives a very happy life and gets away from you okay so that is really nasty and so her her belief system just so we're clear is that the time's up yeah no I got it it's fine I mean it's insanely nasty and we'll talk again my next claim is that college is a scam hello hello hello what's your name I'm Maddox how are you doing good so college is a scam well let's define our terms College being traditional for your college of course University not Community College or Technical College course a scam if we can agree on a definition is where a majority of people who will go through the institution or business uh they're not getting their money's worth their time's worth um and they're being deceived when they sign up so do we agree on those terms yeah perfect okay well what would further definitions what do you think is the purpose of going to college the purpose of college should be a traditional liberal arts education the pursuit of what is good true and beautiful okay that's not what it is uh it should be the betterment of yourself and your soul uh nurturing your character uh and becoming a better citizen understanding the deeper things in life at the very least though it should be preparing one for the job market do you think college does those things I think it does uh but I would add on to your point that I think not only is it for the betterment of your s but it's the for the betterment of society we need historians we need certain majors that may not make as much money I think those are for the betterment of society would you agree that there's some Majors that may not make money
You people are lame!,years Black America is worse than it has been years the generational psych of an entire group of people I'm sure it did I'm not discounting that I'm just trying to understand why is it the more social welfare we've done so we've spent 20 trillion dollar on uplifting black communities 20 trillion and black Americans are poor we've done everything that's been asked you haven't done everything that's been asked though subsidized housing Medicaid public schooling going subsidized College we're talking about2 trillion have been spent on the Great Society and yet Black America is poorer more murderous more dangerous so there's an explanation I'm asking you we are not asking for handouts we are asking for equity and part of equity equity mean you mean taking from other people excuse me it means sharing which is something that you guys seem to have a very hard time doing sharing so somebody has to explain why black America and you haven't is 13% of the population and commits 58% of the murders black people have built and founded the society thank you I was very smart group very opinionate there were a couple other people I kind of felt bad for them they had a lot of strong opinions but they just weren't ready for Prime Time overall very good group very impressive Republicans tend to just focus on like preventing you from arguing your point not actually countering the points that you come up with he often will switch the topic like do a lot of Gish Galloping and like kind of filibustering to get people to not be able to make the points that they want to make and I definitely feel like he did that to me look Charlie's a talented guy there's a reason why he spoke at the RNC he's media trained he's had conversations like
The red flags are a great addition because it shows in real time how people will try to shut down a conversation when they don‚Äôt agree with the narrative,these types of areas but I think it's best that people get involved in debate and entertainment as it helps people grow and critically think in our society I thought it was very valuable I hope people learned something um I think the students were able to refine their arguments and hopefully this gets seen by millions of people where they're able to see what side they land on uh but yeah it's not easy just to stand there be 20 on one but uh only at Jubilee media
Dude got roasted even though he had the questions prepared and prepped. Creepy smile guy is just clicks with his open Color/culture discrimination.,met that met that criteria and that's why she was selected no why I think he was what he was trying to say is oh I'm she's just black she was just calling her black she's not saying I'm doing he's not saying he's not saying I'm doing this because she's black that's not what she said he made a public promise before the selection even began and the process began I will put a black woman on the ticket so you're saying her being dist attorney doesn't matter that's not why but an aw being a failed businessman and making all the comments weird comments he's made well hold on a second that doesn't have like what I'm getting at though is that if she was not a black woman she never would have been chosen as vice president her record was abysmal she was a terrible Attorney General of California she had poorly I'm so sorry I'll be quior I'll be quick I'm so sorry she she gets the next one yeah all right sorry yeah I just have to know do you think Tim Waltz is a Dei candidate okay I just wanted to see consist Dei does not mean black timal was only chosen because the Democrat Party is doing so poorly with white men that they tried to find a white man that they could put on the ticket but then also true Tim Walls is the first White Dei candidate in history okay in the Democratic primaries KLA harros was performing incredibly well and she wasn't performing well in the primaries just because she was black she was performing well in the primaries because during her time as a senator she spoke incredibly eloquently I used to watch hold on a second how did she do in the Democrat primaries she did like much better than
"Words per minute is NOT a measure of intelligence, and interrupting surely is a sign of intolerance.",at conception I care about Senti in life not not so when do brain waves start you think brain dead people should be able to pull the plug on like family should be able to pull the plug on individual got to answer the question when do brain when do brain waves when do brain waves start uh you can see brain waves around 6 to 8 weeks which in brain dead individual there are brain waves as well so the brain waves necessary to produce a subjective experience are met until around 2 can you see it from my perspective that at six to eight weeks those brain waves will actually increase not decrease if allowed the process of development to continue did you know those same EEG scans exist in brain dead people that you don't think are the difference with the brain dead people is that the likelihood of those brain waves actually increasing is very low at 6 to eight weeks when by 15 weeks they can hear the it's irreversible sensation that's what brain death is I know that it's not coma but you're you're you're doing a red herring go back to it's not what's a red herring six a red herring is where you you avoid the topic and you say something that is uh adjacent or symmetrical to what I'm saying but not actually I'm saying me that's not that's not a red herring a six to8 week baby if they're allowed to continue to develop what ends up happening uh at a certain point it will become a sentient being in the future the same way if I keep engaging with my girlfriend there'll be a baby in the future yet I don't care about unless you're infertile which we don't know but so let's let's see let's see the the process of

Find a less ableist format maybe?,and by way it does have to be based it's not based on equity and it's not based on inclusion can you have based upon different character other than race whether or not you're a woman whether or not let let me finish why it's because we are a collection of States we are not a federal project so states rights usurp federals do you know what the 17th amendment is do you know do you know the why the Articles of Confederation failed yes but what is the 10th Amendment because had to right had too much power that's why we specifically aded the let me let me make one point okay which is how did we us to elect Senators it' be population no we used to elect Senators based on state legislatures so the Senate is an extension of the state legislative bodies that's not Dei that's federalism that's the way that our system is set up which is a bottom up citizen-led government to allow the states which are first and foremost Sovereign so it goes in this lad in this country that's still de for those States for those country areas no because it's blind it's not that oh is not only based on race hold on a second diversity for for Country diversity for World equity for World an inclusion of that's an inter point is only because associate with Harris let me ask you a question is there a single instance in Corporate America or Dei is implemented where diversity means anything other than skin color diversity so diversity view women women what fine how about chromosone or diversity or skin color so so so skin color there's gender you had to you have to move the goal poost a little bit because you got destroyed there all right but there's also no I'm just

My comments keep getting Shadowbanned üòêüòë,there's been a War on Drugs is this correct I like I like the War on Drugs you like the War on Drugs so during the War on Drugs it created an epidemic of mass incarceration specifically if you're using drugs no or pedaling drugs if you don't use drugs then you don't go to jail right so you believe that the criminal justice system is Flawless no I've never said Flawless there's a lot of people in jail that shouldn't be in jail there's a lot of problems in any system okay so wait let's CL on that so you believe that a lot of people who have gone to jail shouldn't be in jail a small percent what percent would you say 5% you would say only 5% correct when you have a system of justice you're going to have scummy prosecutors you're going to have bad defense attorneys I have a question can I get a Google what percentage of people currently incarcerated are black it's way larger than well it's hold on it's what it's way larger than no I know but the fact the fact I'm saying the fact I'm saying 5% so that's the point that I'm trying to make exactly who am I Deb am I debating here am I if your own government is pumping drugs yeah so wait okay so I want to make a quick you're right black Americans are in prison far greater than the percentage of the population so the black Americans about 13 to 14% of the population about half prisoners are black so blacks commit more crimes than whites do they commit more murders they commit more arson they commit more kidnappings for example blacks are 133% of the population and they commit 58% of all the murders that's not a War on Drugs That's a culture problem

Rather not,out is this a random black woman that he plucked off the street or is this a qualified DEA general attorney who's had a decorated career leading government positions you can but you keep rambling about things that just aren't relevant to what we're talking it is relevant AB kachar in vetting came across as the more qualified candidate why because they said kamla Harris wasn't very smart wasn't very bright that's their own vetting documents from the from who Joe Biden's own vetting documents show why would he go against that because the base of the Democrat Party demands tribal politics and Dei politics over competency that's completely inur he stated to Jim kber said I will only endorse you in the South Carolina primary if you say that you're going to put a black person preferably a black female on your ticket with you therefore you winnow the entire universe down and say I'm only going to choose from this criteria and let's just think more broadly if you're about to have heart surgery would you rather have a heart surgeon that's good and excellent knows what he's doing or someone that is a black female so and being president is more important than being a heart surgeon aren't you on record saying that you'd be terrified if there was a black pilot that was was flying I did say that but what why what was the full quote I I personally I don't know if you want to expand on yeah so this this ties into this United Airlines said that half of all their new hes are going to be black or women and that standards and pursuit of Excellence is not going to be taken as um seriously as diversity when I'm flying a plane I want to know my pilot is there because they're a good
Charli vs destiny,I can tell you which one is which just by running very simple Elementary blood tests so for example if there was a Hispanic or a white there is no difference in the genetic coding there just isn't why is it important that someone's oh okay my next claim is that kamla Harris is a Dei [Music] candidate a lot of competition Mason yeah exactly good to see you good to see you again um can I define what a Dei candidate is I I think that you're GNA say because she's black and she's a woman she's appointed because Joe Biden promised that and it's is not a testament to her not only that but also in the her getting the nomination of the Democrat Party they said repeatedly we do not want to pass over a black female okay so just those two things but the first one is stronger you're right Joe Biden said I'm going to put on my vice presidency a black female right right so his criteria yeah and that was like Karen bass and KLA Harris so she was not chosen because of her intellect or her accomplishments or because of any of that it was because she happened to fit a couple boxes in fact Amy kachar the vetting at the time was that Amy kobar would have been a better VP and kamla ended up getting it so it's just a statement of fact that she is there not because of her Brilliance or accomplishments but because of her ethnicity so KLA Harris first and foremost there are a lot of criticism that you can give to her on why she wouldn't be an effective president it shouldn't be because she's a woman or because she's black and it seems to be that you're I'm just I just want people to understand and
Want more? SubscribeüëÜ,you think that like tea has to do or testosterone has to do with your manhood like well yes and no I mean for if you are looking at typical testosterone estone rates of women they are far different than those of men but for example like your testosterone rate goes down when you have children for example when you're a man that doesn't make you less of a man they go they go down by by 400 points okay but like when we were talking earlier about like sports right and you were saying that the reason why it's unfair for like like for example a trans woman who used to be a man to be like competing in women's sports you said you cited that they have higher testosterone levels one of about 50 characteristics also lung density the men's hearts are bigger we have greater bone B bone bone density muscle mass okay be faster T to be stronger I I understand but like those factors all come from the hormones during the development process say correct no not necessarily no I mean most of them do well not all of them so for example you could try to pump a young girl's body with testosterone at 8 years old and you can get them stronger you cannot necessarily get them on par with a biological male at puberty you cannot you could try okay but like because there's something in the coding of our genetics the coding of our genetics which is often like controlled by like different like I guess parts of our DNA and also the hormones that are produced that affect the the effective coding ology it's a big part because for example if you just give a kid testosterone that doesn't even get them close to becoming a male or estrogen giving them a

¬†@tuxidokamen¬† Who got roasted? And what open discrimination?,first and foremost there are a lot of criticism that you can give to her on why she wouldn't be an effective president it shouldn't be because she's a woman or because she's black and it seems to be that you're I'm just I just want people to understand and agree she didn't earn this she she absolutely did she has she has a career where she's been not only a de de stands one earn it just so we're clear but like it stands for diversity Equity inclusion I like the meme though I I know what it is but do you at least admit and acknowledge that when Joe Biden was searching for a VP he cared more about skin color and a female than the smartest best person so the the whole conversation with this affirmative action with Dei the whole reason why people bring it in is to make this imaginary scenario that there's a super qualified white man who was overpassed by this unqualified stupid idiot person of color which is such a terrible analogy because it's not true absolutely not true that's not what it is Jo bid did not say I'm going to choose an unqualified person just his own team he's saying that I'm going to have two qualified people if one comes from a different experience it might be better to have a diversity and have a better perception in forms of he said at the South Carolina debate that will pick a black woman as my vice president secondly Amy kachar came out is this a random black woman that he plucked off the street or is this a qualified DEA general attorney who's had a decorated career leading government positions you can but you keep rambling about things that just aren't relevant to what we're talking it is relevant AB kachar
No,do you think men can give birth I think that uh yes or no question I think that a person who is assigned male at Birth I don't think they a signed male at Birth so people are not male at Birth I think that a person see your evidence that college is a scam my friend so what do you say in some cases women without your these are murderers of course not they're not murderers we the difference between an IUD killing a conceived zygote and like a mother going to Planned Parenthood and killing the petus in her room that was actually the best point somebody made it's not about the the cells it's not about no no no I'm speaking no I'm speaking no I'm speaking no I'm speaking no I'm speaking no I'm speaking no I'm speaking hello everyone I am Charlie Kirk founder of Turning Point USA and uh I am surrounded by 20 woke college kids my first prompt is abortion is murder and should be [Music] illegal all right can I maybe go okay hello what's your name Juliana nice to meet you nice to meet you can we get our terms right first yeah okay abortion is the forcible ending of the viability of a being in utero otherwise known as a fetus do we agree that's what abortion is okay yeah okay great and then murder is the intentional taking of Life different than killing or sudden death so murder would be the intent with intent taking another life do we agree with that okay okay and then we agree that murder in general in society should be illegal yeah okay great so yeah no I do want to preface that I'm a Catholic so I think one really important thing that the Bible says is to not judge and just going
"i don‚Äôt care what side you‚Äôre on, personal attacks and rude behavior will never do your argument any justice.
edit: yall need to heal fr",mean on the third on third degree murder however no I don't think women that got abortions or had iuds should go to jail because I think that they have been deceived by mass culture M Mass propaganda secondly the people who should go to jail are the abortionists who are the ones that have been putting the abortion pill the ones that have been doing procedures the ones that have been going into the third trimester and breaking babies backs and inserting them with syringes while the babies are crying and suffocating being born alive and then being dead on the operating table that is who should go to jail oh that was actually the best point somebody made we'll have to we'll have to talk about [Music] it okay whenever I'm talking about this discussion um I always go to the question of what about in The Case of the mother when her life is in danger because I'm a big believer I don't I don't know I'm still iffy on if I think it's a or if it's murder or not but even so I mean I don't want to say murder is Justified guys wait let me just get this one point and then you can vote me out give me one second um say the mother gets pregnant and she knows that if she gives birth she's going to die she has some kind of Health complication then what do you do in section I don't know what that means to C-section they an ins guys wait hold on give me one second go right they go right below the belly button and they deliver the baby and therefore she doesn't have to give birth it's technically birth but it's much safer so that's that's actually safer than an abortion procedure sorry sorry [Music] Lily hello how
College students are so rude. Because they have different opinions they throw insults.,right so you said that there are some classes that if students had to go into debt or had to pay for would not be a good use of their time so it's not representing students well well do you think like high school is scam then cuz I had to pay for high school but I didn't I'm not going to use AP US History in my psychology degree ever well I think AP US History is actually a really good use of time knowing about your country and your history and well but I'm not going to use that in my career that's what we're talking about in the career path for college let's go back to what I said right we said traditional college right fouryear college and what a scam is we're a majority a majority of the people that will go through the Enterprise the business or the institution are not getting their time Worth or their money worth so therefore I go back to my core contention which is a majority of kids that exit College will not use their degree at all when they go to find a job but if you ask them do you think college was a scam I don't think majority of them are going to say yes some of them will some of them are going to well not everyone who's being scammed actively knows they're being scammed people still buy erectile dysfunction drugs off the internet and they get scammed that's their own personal choice of course people have choices to be scammed I'm not saying they don't have a choice I'm making an observation analysis of the institution for example flying Spirit Airlines kind of a scam should be shut down there is some yeah agree there are some things in life we have to take a step

"I have to say he is wrong about the daughter being raped statement, if my daughter had been raped I would make sure she wouldnt have to carry that monstrosity to term. Kids take after their parents the kid would be just as likely to commit rape in the future as the father was. Ntm it is extremely cruel to expect the daughter to carry that on it would be better to remove that mistake than to let her live with it for the rest of her life.",going to give birth and she was going to live would you want her to go through that and carry her that's that's awfully graphic answer it's no but it's a real life scenario that happens to many people the answer is yes the baby would be delivered okay great so I that's insane um but let me tell you why no hold on let me ask you a question there's two ultrasounds I have one is a baby conceived in one is a baby conceived by a loving couple which one is which which which person here which person here was conceived by tell me which one was conceived by you don't know exactly cuz it's all human rights and it's all human beings matter it's but it's about your daughter who's passed to give birth to it and it's going to be tortured by that for the rest of her life that's going to take away every freedom she's ever going to have that's going to ruin her life she's going to grow up and going vitim crime the the point is how you were conceived is irrelevant to what human rights you get when hold on one second if a person conceiv the walks down the side of the street it's not like they don't get First Amendment rights or second amendment rights or the worst thing to do to that do the daughter is to then say hey we're going to go murder the being in inside of you they wouldn't even know like listen they they wouldn't know listen listen listen listen but wouldn't it wouldn't a better story to say something evil happened and we do something good in the face of evil instead of saying we're going to do evil and then murder the being because we're going to we're going to we're going to

Candace Owens vs Woke Liberal College Students,I can tell you which one is which just by running very simple Elementary blood tests so for example if there was a Hispanic or a white there is no difference in the genetic coding there just isn't why is it important that someone's oh okay my next claim is that kamla Harris is a Dei [Music] candidate a lot of competition Mason yeah exactly good to see you good to see you again um can I define what a Dei candidate is I I think that you're GNA say because she's black and she's a woman she's appointed because Joe Biden promised that and it's is not a testament to her not only that but also in the her getting the nomination of the Democrat Party they said repeatedly we do not want to pass over a black female okay so just those two things but the first one is stronger you're right Joe Biden said I'm going to put on my vice presidency a black female right right so his criteria yeah and that was like Karen bass and KLA Harris so she was not chosen because of her intellect or her accomplishments or because of any of that it was because she happened to fit a couple boxes in fact Amy kachar the vetting at the time was that Amy kobar would have been a better VP and kamla ended up getting it so it's just a statement of fact that she is there not because of her Brilliance or accomplishments but because of her ethnicity so KLA Harris first and foremost there are a lot of criticism that you can give to her on why she wouldn't be an effective president it shouldn't be because she's a woman or because she's black and it seems to be that you're I'm just I just want people to understand and

"and by the way, I think he lost 3 out 4 debates. Not saying the group won, though. But from the point of defending of his position and giving convincing arguments.",didn't earn it she didn't win a Democrat primary she dropped out in the Democrat Primary in 2020 she's never been likable she's got there simply because of race not because of Competency not because she's good at her job and I think that's wrong and it needs to be called out you're bringing up qualitative examples these are all subjective qualitative examples her race her competency her dropping out of the election these that's not what you said earlier this is I'm talking about the points you've just bought up multiple qualitative points and these points can be believed by you and not by me as you believe in a God and I don't these are qualitative arguments that you're making against me for this and I can believe differently than you and I think we can agree to disagree on this one okay fine perfect okay I think this is going to take the entire time you're welcome 30 on 30 off how do you feel about the Senate uh far as her her tiebreaking vote of the Senate no no no I'm just saying like Senate like like the Senate is technically Dei in a certain sense for like small states like Wyoming gets people W Wyoming get a greater vot than in California like Rhode island in Hawaii I'm giving you an example California I get less of a vote than someone who exists in Wyoming so we're giving people in Wyoming more say than they necessarily should given that they're one individual so why do you believe in Dei as it relates to how our government is set up we don't believe in Dei in terms of allowing for people who are black or who are women to be in positions of power that they have not been allowed in historically speaking so um is the electoral
I would want more if you would let people have an actual conversation...,OB genitals I'm not obsess genitals but I could do a blood sampling right now and I could see exactly what you are because every single one of your trillions of cells are either coded with XX or XY no no how much surgery or whatever I think that you are man but you could fool me you could take hormones you could play camouflage like I could fool you to be Hispanic if I had the right Hollywood makeup director that doesn't mean that you are the thing though but but you're going from an objective biological perspective which we've already talked about with sex I'm talking about a social construct or a social utility so like if we were at a restaurant right I'm sitting down and I'm sitting down at the table and you're telling the waiter hey I want to go sit with blank what would you use with you he doesn't know my name yeah I'm sitting over there that guy yeah yes correct guy you're going to typically use he or him or you're going to say that guy like you just said correct because you're ascribing the male gender to me based on my I say I could be an error maybe you are a biological woman and then you'd correct yourself right that take may maybe maybe not so that's what we that is exactly what we're trying to say we're so the question is that do you think that Womanhood can then be assumed just through costume design it's not costume design what is it then it's performative social characteris so you could act that's what gender is great it so you could it's like a theater troop it's not a theater troop these are social these are social can be appropriated no they're C they're categories that's what it is so so
Charlie Kirk vs.idiots!,I can tell you which one is which just by running very simple Elementary blood tests so for example if there was a Hispanic or a white there is no difference in the genetic coding there just isn't why is it important that someone's oh okay my next claim is that kamla Harris is a Dei [Music] candidate a lot of competition Mason yeah exactly good to see you good to see you again um can I define what a Dei candidate is I I think that you're GNA say because she's black and she's a woman she's appointed because Joe Biden promised that and it's is not a testament to her not only that but also in the her getting the nomination of the Democrat Party they said repeatedly we do not want to pass over a black female okay so just those two things but the first one is stronger you're right Joe Biden said I'm going to put on my vice presidency a black female right right so his criteria yeah and that was like Karen bass and KLA Harris so she was not chosen because of her intellect or her accomplishments or because of any of that it was because she happened to fit a couple boxes in fact Amy kachar the vetting at the time was that Amy kobar would have been a better VP and kamla ended up getting it so it's just a statement of fact that she is there not because of her Brilliance or accomplishments but because of her ethnicity so KLA Harris first and foremost there are a lot of criticism that you can give to her on why she wouldn't be an effective president it shouldn't be because she's a woman or because she's black and it seems to be that you're I'm just I just want people to understand and
"As soon as a real conversation starts, the red flags come out.",at conception I care about Senti in life not not so when do brain waves start you think brain dead people should be able to pull the plug on like family should be able to pull the plug on individual got to answer the question when do brain when do brain waves when do brain waves start uh you can see brain waves around 6 to 8 weeks which in brain dead individual there are brain waves as well so the brain waves necessary to produce a subjective experience are met until around 2 can you see it from my perspective that at six to eight weeks those brain waves will actually increase not decrease if allowed the process of development to continue did you know those same EEG scans exist in brain dead people that you don't think are the difference with the brain dead people is that the likelihood of those brain waves actually increasing is very low at 6 to eight weeks when by 15 weeks they can hear the it's irreversible sensation that's what brain death is I know that it's not coma but you're you're you're doing a red herring go back to it's not what's a red herring six a red herring is where you you avoid the topic and you say something that is uh adjacent or symmetrical to what I'm saying but not actually I'm saying me that's not that's not a red herring a six to8 week baby if they're allowed to continue to develop what ends up happening uh at a certain point it will become a sentient being in the future the same way if I keep engaging with my girlfriend there'll be a baby in the future yet I don't care about unless you're infertile which we don't know but so let's let's see let's see the the process of
Econ majors cant be liberals change my mind,genders however let's get back to the core contention can I ask my question again real quick well I want to get back to my core contention a scam so the majority of kids that go to college if they end up getting a job at all they end up getting a job that does not require a college degree do you think that certain jobs that may not associate with a direct major can incorporate skills that you learn from a major I think I'm personally I'm an econ major and depending on what job I do in the future I can still use the skills earned from so tell me about Milton fredman tell me about Milton Freedman he is an economist from how about Thomas Soul Thomas Soul lud vanus lud well I will say that first how about I'd love to see you answer the gender studies question we will get there later that's that's what psychedelics are for uh who's [Music] next um well I think it's difficult to think about just one major thinking about just gender studies like sure like not everyone should be a gender Studies major we need doctors we need lawyers we need everything however why does it matter if 10 people want to be a gender Studies major and it matters to them like not everyone can be a lawyer not everyone can be a doctor there needs to be some people and you know what yeah it sucks that some people do go to college and get a degree and then they end up not in a Workforce for that but I don't think that has to do with like college was a scam it's more like maybe that just wasn't the path for them or that life choice was just too hard to get for them but some people

can we remove the red flags? its so disruptive and people who are trying to genuinely have a respectful debate get voted out while people are just insulting get supported???,first of all if you count the abortion pill you're right but that's a separate thing than a chemic chemical abortion and surgical abortion different things and I'm not debating I'm not I'm not debating you I'm debating her so if you want to do the flags and come back in try and be faster next time so let me ask you this so the question is we should try to limit unjust suffering of human beings right sure okay that's my position is that there's unjust suffering of anywhere between 1.4 to 1.6 million abortions a year of human beings that are being massacred in the womb and so that's not a woman's rights issue that's not a men's rights issue that's just a human rights issue okay the best way to decrease abortions happening is proper sex education limiting abortion and making abortion illegal does not actually decrease the amount of abortions that happen so what is your evidence of that what is my evidence of that because we have increased sex education last 30 years we've had no our sex education is so bad in America well by bad what do you mean by that we have we have more access to birth control for young kids we have more kids that are learning you birth control at a younger age we have more of that in our public school system and we've seen all the trends actually go in a negative Direction so in fact we see that the more sex exucation there is the the more disturbing those Trends are so you say that let me ask just one more thing you say that if we make abortion illegal people will still do it should we then just make gang violence legal because no I'm saying if you actually wanted to decrease the amount of abortions that

Myron Gaines next please! :D,the most gifted or the most talented or the most accomplished he said so he said I'm going to choose a black female and so by definition that is Dei that is not the definition of Dei by him saying that he was going to choose a black female that could insinuate that he already had comma mind for the role no way does that insinuate that she's Dei what is Dei then Dei would be choosing somebody based on their race no it's giving people of color the opportunity to be welcomed into spaces in which they typically AR able to get there's never been a female black vice president and why do you think that is well not why you just said that's Dei so by definition she's Dei okay so she represents diversity within the government no I'm saying she got elevated because she was a black female because if that were the case I'd be the president right now do do you do you think do you think kamla Harris was chosen because of her intelligence her qualifications and her intelligence really wow if you compare what's greatest accom what's her greatest accomplish prosecutor within the Northern California area you mean letting out violent criminals and turning San Francisco one of the most murderous dangerous arson fied homeless field slums in the country that's her greatest accomplishment see I actually went to UC Berkeley so I lived there I don't know if you did uh I went around Berkeley is a slum Berkeley is a slum have you stepped into Berkeley yes I have you think Oakland and Berkeley have you lived in Berkeley I've lived in Oakland as well your basing your you think the Bay Area is like a good area in this country I'm from Vegas so I'm not from the bay born raised in
